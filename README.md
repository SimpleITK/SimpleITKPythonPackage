# SimpleITKPythonPackage

This project provides a `setup.py` script that can build, install, and package SimpleITK for Python. [SimpleITK](http://www.simpleitk.org) is a simplified programming layer on top of the [Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit](https://itk.org) (ITK).  ITK is an open-source, cross-platform system that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis.

SimpleITK is available for binary downloads from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimpleITK) for many common platforms. Also a source distribution available of this repository which may be used when an appropriate binary [wheel](http://pythonwheels.com) is not available.

To install SimpleITK:

```bash
pip install SimpleITK
```

## Installing SimpleITK for Python from the Python Packaging Source

```bash
pip install SimpleITK
```

### Prerequisites

Building requires:
* [CMake](https://cmake.org)
* Git
* C++ Compiler - Platform specific requirements are summarized in [scikit-build documentation](http://scikit-build.readthedocs.io).
* Python
** pip >= 9.0.0
** setuptools >= 28.0.0

Please ensure that `pip` and `setuptools` are up to date and are a recent version.

There is also the implicit requirement of `scikit-build`, which will be automatically be temporarily installed with the recommended installation methods.

The CMake and optional Ninja build tool can dependencies be provided through pip if needed:

```bash
pip install cmake ninja
```

### Compilations and Installation from Github

SimpleITK can be compiled and install directly from the github repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/SimpleITK/SimpleITKPythonPackage.git -v
```

### Compilation and Installation from Source Distribution

Alternatively, SimpleITK for Python can be compiled and installed from the SimpleITKPythonPackage python source distribution.

``bash
pip install SimpleITKPythonPackage-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

The source distributions are available from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimpleITK) and [Source Forge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/simpleitk/files/SimpleITK/1.0.0/Python). They are labeled as `SimpleITKPythonPackages` in the Python sub-directory as opposed to just `SimpleITK` for the source archive of the general SimpleITK repository.

## Automated wheels building with scripts

Steps required to build wheels on Linux, MacOSX and Windows have been automated. The
following sections outline how to use the associated scripts.

### Linux

On any linux distribution with `docker` and `bash` installed, running the script
`dockcross-manylinux-build-wheels.sh` will create 32 and 64-bit wheels for both
python 2.x and python 3.x in the `dist` directory.

For example:

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/SimpleITK/SimpleITKPythonPackage.git
[...]

$ ./scripts/dockcross-manylinux-build-wheels.sh
[...]

$ ls -1 dist/
SimpleITK-0.11.0-cp27-cp27m-manylinux1_i686.whl
SimpleITK-0.11.0-cp27-cp27m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
SimpleITK-0.11.0-cp27-cp27mu-manylinux1_i686.whl
SimpleITK-0.11.0-cp27-cp27mu-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
SimpleITK-0.11.0-cp33-cp33m-manylinux1_i686.whl
SimpleITK-0.11.0-cp33-cp33m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
SimpleITK-0.11.0-cp34-cp34m-manylinux1_i686.whl
SimpleITK-0.11.0-cp34-cp34m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
SimpleITK-0.11.0-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_i686.whl
SimpleITK-0.11.0-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
```

### MacOSX

*To be documented*

### Windows

*To be documented*

## Prerequisites

Building wheels requires:
* [CMake](https://cmake.org)
* Git
* C++ Compiler - Platform specific requirements are summarized in [scikit-build documentation](http://scikit-build.readthedocs.io).
* Python

## Detailed build instructions

### Building SimpleITK Python wheels

Build the SimpleITK Python wheel with the following command:

```
mkvirtualenv build-sitk
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

### Efficiently building wheels for different version of python

If on a given platform you would like to build wheels for different version of python, you can build the SimpleITK core libraries first and reuse them when building each wheel.

Here are the steps:

1. Build `SimpleITKPythonPackage` with `SimpleITKPythonPackage_BUILD_PYTHON` set to `OFF`

2. Build "flavor" of package using:

```
python setup.py bdist_wheel -- \
  -DSimpleITK_DIR:PATH=/path/to/SimpleITKPythonPackage-core-build/SimpleITK-superbuild/SimpleITK-build \
  -DSWIG_EXECUTABLE:PATH=/path/to/SimpleITKPythonPackage-core-build/SimpleITK-superbuild/Swig/bin/swig
```
